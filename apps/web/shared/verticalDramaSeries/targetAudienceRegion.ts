/**
 * Vertical Drama Series — target-audience region (spec feature 131 follow-up,
 * 2026-07-06 character-prompt quality upgrade).
 *
 * Additive series-level setting controlling the default ethnicity/regional
 * styling look for every AI-generated character/person image (portraits,
 * turnarounds, character sheets, start frames, angle-grid variations, image
 * repairs). Stored inside the EXISTING `verticalDramaSeries.bible` jsonb
 * column (`VerticalDramaSeriesBible.targetAudienceRegion`) — no new DB
 * column, no migration.
 *
 * IMPORTANT — precedence rule: this is only a DEFAULT. Whenever an
 * individual character's own `description` states an explicit
 * ethnicity/nationality/region, THAT description always wins over the
 * series-level region default. Every prompt-building call site that injects
 * the region descriptor must phrase it as a default/fallback, never as an
 * override instruction.
