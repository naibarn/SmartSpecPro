## Codex Compatibility Notes

This is a Codex-adapted portable skill. Tool commands use local assets under `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/`. Use Codex shell/file tools such as `exec_command`, `apply_patch`, `rg`, and targeted file reads instead of platform-specific tool names. Do not assume platform-specific slash commands or browser MCP tools exist.

External side effects such as deploys, pushes, tags, npm publishes, production smoke tests with credentials, or destructive fixes require explicit user confirmation immediately before execution. For read-only scans, proceed normally.

# SEO Audit + AI Visibility

Search optimization audit with AI visibility signals. Finds issues AND fixes them.

## Process

### Phase 1: Scan

Run the SEO scanner on the project:
```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/seo-scanner.mjs <project-directory>
```

Parse the JSON output for findings and scores (seo, geo, aeo).

### Phase 2: Report

Present findings grouped by category with severity:
- **SEO**: meta tags, OG tags, headings, alt text, canonical, robots.txt, sitemap
- **GEO**: structured data, llms.txt, content structure for AI
- **AEO**: FAQPage schema, speakable markup, snippet optimization

### Phase 3: Fix

For each finding, apply the appropriate fix:

**SEO fixes** (use Edit tool on HTML files):
- Missing title → add `<title>` in `<head>`
- Missing meta description → add `<meta name="description" content="...">`
- Missing OG tags → generate from page content
- Missing H1 → add appropriate heading
- Missing alt text → add descriptive alt attributes
- Missing canonical → add `<link rel="canonical">`
- Missing sitemap → run: `node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/sitemap-generator.mjs <dir> <url>`
- Missing robots.txt → run: `node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/robots-generator.mjs <dir> <url>`
- Missing favicon → warn user to add one

**GEO fixes**:
- Missing llms.txt → run: `node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/llms-txt-generator.mjs <dir>`
- Missing structured data → run: `node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/structured-data-generator.mjs <dir> --type=<type>`
- Improve content structure: add clear headings, FAQ sections, definitive statements

**AEO fixes**:
- Missing JSON-LD → generate appropriate schema type
- Missing FAQ schema → create FAQPage structured data from page content
- Snippet optimization → restructure key answers to 40-60 words

### Phase 4: Search Engine Registration (GSC + Bing)

**Google Search Console** (requires SKILLPACK_GSC_CREDENTIALS):
```bash
# Submit sitemap
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/gsc-client.mjs submit-sitemap <site-url> <sitemap-url>

# Check if pages are indexed
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/gsc-client.mjs inspect-url <site-url> <page-url>

# See what keywords you rank for
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/gsc-client.mjs query <site-url> 28

# List all submitted sitemaps
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/gsc-client.mjs list-sitemaps <site-url>
```

**Bing Webmaster Tools** (requires SKILLPACK_BING_KEY):
```bash
# Submit sitemap (also powers DuckDuckGo + ChatGPT Search)
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/bing-webmaster.mjs submit-sitemap <site-url> <sitemap-url>

# Submit specific URLs for fast indexing
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/bing-webmaster.mjs submit-url <site-url> <page-url>

# Batch submit multiple URLs
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/bing-webmaster.mjs submit-url-batch <site-url> <url1> <url2> ...

# Check URL traffic
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/bing-webmaster.mjs url-info <site-url> <page-url>
```

If credentials are not set, show setup instructions from the tool's error output. Do NOT skip this phase — submitting sitemaps to both GSC and Bing is critical for indexing speed.

**Why Bing matters for AI search:** Bing's index powers ChatGPT Search, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo. Submitting your sitemap to Bing directly improves AI search visibility.

### Phase 4b: Content Quality Analysis

Run content scoring on all pages:
```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/content-scorer.mjs <project-directory>
```

For pages with a known target keyword:
```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/content-scorer.mjs <project-directory> --keyword=<keyword>
```

Report readability scores (Flesch-Kincaid), keyword density, thin content, and GEO heading optimization.

### Phase 4c: Social Preview Validation

Validate Open Graph tags and image accessibility:
```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/og-validator.mjs <project-directory>
```

Fix missing OG tags, broken OG images, and oversized preview images.

### Phase 4d: Redirect Audit

If a production URL is available, check for redirect chains:
```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/redirect-checker.mjs --sitemap=<sitemap-url>
```

Fix redirect chains (consolidate to single hop), convert 302s to 301s, and resolve mixed HTTP/HTTPS.

### Phase 5: Verify

Re-run the scanner to confirm fixes and report before/after scores.

Save scores for historical comparison:
```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/audit-history.mjs save <project-dir> seo <score>
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/audit-history.mjs save <project-dir> geo <score>
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/seo-audit/tools/audit-history.mjs save <project-dir> aeo <score>
```

### Phase 6: AI Search Content Strategy

After technical fixes, advise on content-level optimizations that the scanner cannot automate:

**GEO Content Patterns (for AI citation):**
- Rewrite key H2 headers as questions: "What is [topic]", "How does [feature] work", "Why use [product]"
- Add 1-2 sentence TL;DR summaries under important H2 sections — AI engines extract these as standalone answers
- Use plain-language definitions before introducing nuance: "[Product] is [clear definition]"
- Write in citation-ready format: concise, factual, quotable — avoid vague marketing copy
- Create comparison tables, statistics pages, and glossaries — these are the most-cited page formats by AI

**E-E-A-T Signals (for AI trust):**
- Add Author/Person schema with credentials, role, and expertise
- Include first-hand experience statements: "We tested", "In our experience", "Based on [N] customers"
- Add original visuals, screenshots, and data — AI cannot synthesize these, so they prove authenticity
- Ensure author bios establish subject-matter relevance on every content page

**AI Bot Access:**
- Verify robots.txt explicitly allows GPTBot (ChatGPT), PerplexityBot, and Claude-Web
- Block Google-Extended and CCBot only if you want to prevent AI training (not citation)

**Citation-Worthy Page Formats:**
- Ultimate guides consolidating a topic into one authoritative resource
- "[Topic] Statistics (2026)" pages centralizing referenceable data
- "Best [Category] Tools Compared" with explicit comparison tables
- FAQ pages with direct, quotable answers (not marketing fluff)

**Key test:** "If your content can't answer a question clearly in 30 seconds, AI engines won't select it for generated answers."

### Phase 7: Content Audit Framework

For SEO specialists working on client sites, provide a content audit after the technical scan:

**Content Health Assessment:**
- Flag pages with <300 words as thin content — recommend consolidation or expansion
- Identify pages with duplicate titles/descriptions — each page must be unique
- Find orphan pages (0 internal links pointing to them) — add links or consider removing
- Check internal link distribution — important pages should have 3+ internal links

**Competitor Gap Analysis Guidance:**
After technical fixes, advise the user to:
1. Search their top 5 target keywords in ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Google AI Overviews
2. Note which competitors are cited — study their content structure
3. Identify topics competitors cover that the client site doesn't
4. Create "definitive answer" content for each gap — direct, structured, quotable

**Content Update/Consolidate/Delete Decision Framework:**
For each existing content page, recommend one of:
- **Update**: Has traffic potential but content is outdated or thin → refresh with current data
- **Consolidate**: Multiple pages targeting the same keyword → merge into one authoritative page
- **Delete/Redirect**: Zero traffic, zero backlinks, no strategic value → 301 redirect to relevant page
- **Leave**: Performing well, no changes needed

**Page Speed Budget by Page Type:**
- Landing pages / homepage: target Lighthouse 90+
- Blog posts / content pages: target Lighthouse 85+
- Dashboards / app pages: target Lighthouse 70+ (not search-indexed)
- API-only backends: skip Lighthouse entirely

### Phase 8: Domain Authority & Backlink Strategy

This skill cannot check backlinks (requires paid APIs like Ahrefs/Semrush with massive crawl indexes). Instead, provide strategic guidance that a $10K/month SEO consultant would give:

**Internal Link Optimization (we CAN automate):**
The scanner already detects orphan pages and pages with zero internal links. After fixing those:
- Ensure every important page has 3+ internal links pointing to it
- Use descriptive anchor text with keywords (not "click here" or "read more")
- Add contextual links within content, not just navigation
- Create hub pages that link to all related content (topic clusters)

**Backlink Acquisition Strategy (guidance for user):**

*High-value link building tactics (ranked by ROI):*
1. **Create link-worthy assets** — original research, data studies, industry surveys, free tools, calculators. These attract natural links.
2. **Guest posting** — write for authoritative sites in your niche. One link from a DR60+ site > 100 links from spam sites.
3. **Broken link building** — find broken links on competitor sites, offer your content as replacement.
4. **HARO/Qwoted/Featured** — respond to journalist queries to earn media mentions with backlinks.
5. **Competitor backlink analysis** — use Ahrefs/Semrush free trials to find where competitors get links, then target the same sources.
6. **Strategic partnerships** — co-create content with complementary businesses, cross-link naturally.

*What NOT to do:*
- Never buy links (Google penalizes this)
- Never use PBNs (private blog networks)
- Never spam forum/comment links
- Never use automated link building tools

**Domain Authority Monitoring (guidance for user):**
- Check DA/DR monthly via free Ahrefs Webmaster Tools or Moz free tier
- Track referring domains, not just total backlinks (10 links from 10 domains > 100 links from 1 domain)
- Monitor for toxic backlinks quarterly and disavow via GSC if needed

## Key Principle

**Fix, don't just audit.** Every finding should have a concrete fix applied. Every content page should have a strategy to be cited by AI. Every client engagement should include technical fixes + content audit + backlink strategy.

## Portable Auditor Contract

Use this section when the SEO audit needs to behave like a standalone reviewer or scorecard component across different assistant runtimes.

### Inputs

- Target: project directory, built site directory, or public URL when applicable.
- Optional production base URL for sitemap, robots, and social preview checks.

### Required Checks

1. Run the bundled SEO scanner against the target.
2. Parse and preserve `scores.seo`, `scores.geo`, `scores.aeo`, and every finding.
3. Check likely public/build roots for `sitemap.xml`, `robots.txt`, `llms.txt`, and favicon assets.
4. Count safe auto-fixes that are available without credentials or production writes.
5. Treat credential-backed checks such as search console submission as skipped when environment variables are absent.

### Severity Handling

- Group findings by SEO, GEO, and AEO.
- Preserve scanner severity when available.
- Do not downgrade missing AI discovery files when the site is content-driven or documentation-heavy.
- Report blocked credential-backed work as setup-required, not failed.

### JSON Report

Return this shape when participating in a larger scorecard:

```json
{
  "category": "seo",
  "scores": {
    "seo": 0,
    "geo": 0,
    "aeo": 0
  },
  "findings": [
    {
