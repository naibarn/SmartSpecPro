## Codex Compatibility Notes

This is a Codex-adapted portable skill. Tool commands use local assets under `${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/architecture/tools/`. Use Codex shell/file tools such as `exec_command`, `apply_patch`, `rg`, and targeted file reads instead of platform-specific tool names. Do not assume platform-specific slash commands or browser MCP tools exist.

External side effects such as deploys, pushes, tags, npm publishes, production smoke tests with credentials, or destructive fixes require explicit user confirmation immediately before execution. For read-only scans, proceed normally.

# Living Architecture Map

Auto-generates and maintains architecture diagrams from your actual code. Always up-to-date.

## Process

### Phase 1: Scan

```bash
node ${CODEX_HOME:-$HOME/.codex}/skills/architecture/tools/architecture-mapper.mjs <project-directory>
```

Parse the JSON output for architecture data and diagrams.

### Phase 2: Present Diagrams

Display each Mermaid diagram with context:

**System Architecture:**
High-level view of all components and how they connect.
```mermaid
[system diagram from tool output]
```

**API Route Map:**
All endpoints organized by resource.
```mermaid
[routes diagram from tool output]
```

**Database Schema:**
Entity-relationship diagram of all tables and relations.
```mermaid
[database ER diagram from tool output]
```

**Data Flow:**
Sequence diagram showing how a typical request flows through the system.
```mermaid
[data flow diagram from tool output]
```

### Phase 3: Architecture Analysis

Based on the scanned data, provide analysis:

**Strengths:**
- Clear layer separation
- No circular dependencies
- Well-organized middleware chain

**Concerns:**
- Circular dependencies found (list them)
- Orphan modules (files imported by nothing)
- Large files that may need splitting
- Missing middleware (no auth, no rate limiting, etc.)

**Service Dependencies:**
List all external services and how they're used. Flag any that are single points of failure.

### Phase 4: Save Diagrams

Save architecture documentation:

1. Create `docs/architecture/` directory
2. Save `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` with all diagrams
3. Save individual diagram files if needed

The document should be self-contained and renderable in GitHub (GitHub supports Mermaid in markdown).

### Phase 5: Recommendations

Based on architecture analysis:

1. **Circular dependencies** — suggest how to break cycles
2. **Orphan modules** — suggest removal or integration
3. **Missing patterns** — suggest middleware, error handling, or caching if absent
4. **Scalability concerns** — identify bottlenecks (single database, no caching, synchronous processing)

## Keeping Diagrams Updated

Recommend running `/architecture` after any significant structural change:
- Adding new API routes
- Adding new database tables
- Integrating new external services
- Major refactors

The diagrams are generated from code, so they're always accurate when re-run.

## Key Principle

**The map IS the territory.** Architecture diagrams that drift from reality are worse than no diagrams. Because these are auto-generated from code, they're always truthful.
