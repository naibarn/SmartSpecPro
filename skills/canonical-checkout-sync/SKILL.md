# Canonical Source Preparation

Follow the shared [development lifecycle contract](../development-lifecycle/SKILL.md) for canonical target selection and validation handoff. This skill prepares an exact source revision; it does not define work ownership or dependency waiting.

Use this after a requested revision is integrated into the repository's canonical history and before build, test, package, deploy, or verification work. It prepares an isolated Git worktree and a fenced source lease. It does not align, reset, clean, or switch the developer checkout.

## Repository policy

Each repository configures its source authority in `.development-repository.toml`:

```toml
[repository]
repository_id = "stable-project-repository-id"
remote = "origin"
canonical_ref = "refs/heads/main" # example only; set from this repository's policy
source_root = "~/.cache/codex/canonical-sources"
```

`canonical_ref` is policy data; it may name `refs/heads/develop`, `refs/heads/trunk`, or another protected ref. Do not infer `main`. `source_root` must be outside the developer checkout. Another project supplies its own policy and gets a distinct workspace and lease namespace.

## Prepare exact source

Run from the target repository or set `CODEX_REPOSITORY_ROOT`:

```bash
skills/canonical-checkout-sync/scripts/prepare-canonical-checkout.sh \
  <repository-root> <integrated-source-sha> <required-integrated-sha>
```

The third argument may be omitted when no specific integrated change must be proven. Set `CODEX_SOURCE_PURPOSE` to `build`, `test`, `package`, `deploy`, or `verify`; the default is `deploy`. Set `CODEX_SOURCE_POLICY` to use a policy file at another path.

Preparation fetches the configured canonical ref, verifies that the requested source revision is in its history and that the required change is an ancestor, then creates or reuses a clean detached worktree at that exact SHA. The result is JSON containing `source_revision`, `isolated_workspace`, `lease_file`, `lease_id`, `fencing_generation`, and `source_verified`.

The shared developer checkout may be dirty, detached, or on a feature branch. Its status and contents remain unchanged. A source root inside that checkout is rejected.

## Run under the lease

Use the lease values returned by preparation:

```bash
skills/canonical-checkout-sync/scripts/run-certified-command.sh \
  <lease-file> <lease-id> <fencing-generation> -- <command> [args...]
```

The runner checks the lease fence, expiry, workspace cleanliness, and exact source SHA immediately before execution. It holds an exclusive active lease, renews it during execution, and expires it when the command exits. A reclaimed lease has a higher fencing generation; stale lease holders cannot run or renew work.

Concurrent operations for distinct repository/revision/purpose tuples use independent workspaces and leases. Requests for an already-active tuple are rejected. Do not run commands directly in the isolated workspace without the certified runner when the operation depends on the lease.

## Boundaries

- This skill certifies source selection and execution placement only. A successful source lease is not a passing build, test, deployment, or runtime check.
- Bind all verification results to `source_revision`; a later revision can stale earlier evidence.
- Heavy verification and long-running execution still use the repository's canonical `worker_jobs` plus outbox control plane where required. This source lease is not a job queue.
- The older `canonical-sync-preflight.sh`, dirty-rescue, and local-branch realignment helpers are not part of this path. Do not use them to prepare build input.
